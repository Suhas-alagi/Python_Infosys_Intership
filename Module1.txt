# üìò Data Preprocessing

## **1. Introduction**

In any data science or machine learning project, raw data is rarely ready for direct analysis. Real-world datasets often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicate records, and noise. If we directly apply models on such data, the results will be inaccurate and misleading.

Therefore, **Data Preprocessing** is the first and most important step to clean and transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis. Once the data is prepared, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, which helps us understand the underlying structure, trends, and relationships within the dataset before applying predictive models.

Together, Data Preprocessing and EDA form the foundation for building reliable and meaningful machine learning solutions.

## **2. Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing refers to the techniques used to clean and prepare data for further analysis. The major steps include:

### **2.1 Data Collection**

* Data is gathered from different sources such as CSV files, databases, APIs, sensors, or online repositories.
* In the case of air quality analysis, data can be collected from **CPCB** (Central Pollution Control Board) and **OpenAQ** platforms.

### **2.2 Data Cleaning**

* **Handling Missing Values:** Missing entries are common in real-world datasets. They can be handled by removing rows/columns, replacing them with mean/median values, or using interpolation methods.
* **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate rows increase redundancy and can mislead analysis.
* **Correcting Data Types:** Dates should be converted to `datetime` objects, numeric values should not be stored as strings.

### **2.3 Data Transformation**

* **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling numerical values so that they fall within a standard range, which helps machine learning models perform better.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting text categories (like city names, station codes) into numerical values using label encoding or one-hot encoding.

### **2.4 Feature Selection and Extraction**

* Choosing relevant columns (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ for air quality).
* Removing unnecessary information that does not contribute to analysis.

### **2.5 Data Integration**

* Combining multiple datasets (for example, merging CPCB and OpenAQ datasets for comparison).

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA is the process of examining datasets to summarize their key characteristics, often using visualization techniques. The aim is to **discover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions** before modeling.

### **3.1 Objectives of EDA**

1. Understand the distribution of variables.
2. Identify relationships between features.
3. Detect outliers and anomalies.
4. Recognize trends over time (especially in time-series datasets like air quality).

### **3.2 Types of EDA**

* **Univariate Analysis:** Examining one variable at a time (e.g., histogram of PM2.5 values).
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between two variables (e.g., scatter plot of PM2.5 vs PM10).
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Analyzing interactions among three or more variables (e.g., correlation heatmap of pollutants).

### **3.3 Common Techniques in EDA**

1. **Summary Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles.
2. **Data Visualization:**

   * Line plots to analyze pollutant trends over time.
   * Histograms and box plots to understand distributions and outliers.
   * Heatmaps to check correlations between pollutants.
3. **Correlation Analysis:**

   * Helps identify whether pollutants move together (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10 usually have strong positive correlation).
4. **Seasonal/Temporal Analysis:**

   * Since air quality is time-dependent, resampling to daily, weekly, or monthly averages helps observe seasonal changes.

## **4. Resampling in Time-Series Data**

Air quality datasets are often collected in short intervals (hourly or minutely). To simplify analysis:

* **Daily averages** show short-term fluctuations.
* **Weekly averages** reveal medium-term cycles.
* **Monthly averages** highlight long-term seasonal variations.

Resampling reduces noise and makes patterns easier to study.


## **5. Feature Preparation for Forecasting**

After EDA, new features are engineered to make the dataset suitable for predictive modeling. Common techniques include:

1. **Lag Features:** Using past values of a pollutant (e.g., yesterday‚Äôs PM2.5, last week‚Äôs PM2.5) to predict future values.
2. **Rolling Averages:** Using moving averages (e.g., 7-day rolling mean) to smooth fluctuations and highlight trends.
3. **Time-based Features:** Extracting features like day of week, month, or season, which may influence pollution levels.

These features are crucial for machine learning or deep learning models (such as ARIMA, Random Forest, or LSTM) in forecasting air quality.

## **1. Introduction to EDA**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to discover patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships among variables before applying forecasting or machine learning models. In the context of air quality datasets, EDA helps us:

* Understand **pollutant behavior over time**.
* Identify **dominant pollutants** in a region.
* Explore **correlations** between pollutants.
* Detect **seasonal variations** and **pollution spikes**.

---

## **2. Pollutant Trends Analysis**

Pollutant trend analysis shows how pollutant levels vary **across days, weeks, months, and seasons**.

* **Line Plots:** By plotting pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, and O‚ÇÉ against time, we observe fluctuations.
* **Key Observations in Trends:**

  * **PM2.5 and PM10** usually show higher levels in winter due to low wind speed and temperature inversions.
  * **NO‚ÇÇ and CO** often spike during peak traffic hours.
  * **SO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ** may show industrial or seasonal variations.

üìå Example: A line chart of daily PM2.5 reveals whether air quality improves during rainy seasons or worsens in winters.

---

## **3. Correlation Analysis**

Correlation analysis measures the strength of relationships between pollutants.

* **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap):**

  * A heatmap of pollutants shows pairwise correlations.
  * Example:

    * **PM2.5 and PM10** often have a **strong positive correlation** (both caused by dust, smoke, and vehicle emissions).
    * **NO‚ÇÇ and CO** may correlate due to combustion sources like vehicles.
    * **O‚ÇÉ** may show a negative or weak correlation because it is secondary pollutant formed by photochemical reactions.

* **Scatter Plots:** Used to visualize the relationship between two pollutants (e.g., PM2.5 vs PM10).

üìå High correlations suggest that pollutants may share similar sources, while weak correlations indicate independent pollution factors.

---

## **4. Seasonal & Temporal Patterns**

* **Daily/Weekly Trends:** Show short-term variations (e.g., higher pollution during rush hours or weekdays).
* **Monthly/Seasonal Trends:** Reveal long-term patterns (e.g., higher pollution in winters due to calm winds).
* **Yearly Trends:** Help compare pollution changes across years.

üìå Example: Resampled weekly averages of NO‚ÇÇ can reveal reduction during lockdowns or festivals.

---

## **5. Insights from EDA**

* Identified which pollutant is the most **dominant** (often PM2.5 in Indian cities).
* Observed **seasonal peaks and drops** in pollutants.
* Found **strong correlations** (e.g., PM2.5 ‚Üî PM10) and weak correlations (e.g., O‚ÇÉ with other gases).
* Discovered **outliers or sudden spikes**, possibly linked to events like Diwali, crop burning, or traffic jams.

## **6. Steps in Resampling & Feature Preparation**

6.1 **Load Dataset**

* Import CSV into pandas.
* Parse the date column as `datetime`.

6.2 **Check Time Frequency**

* Air quality datasets are often irregular (missing timestamps).
* Use `df.info()` and `df.index` to check time gaps.

6.3 **Resample Data**

* Use `pandas.resample()` to convert into fixed intervals.
* Example:

  * Hourly ‚Üí Daily (`df.resample('D').mean()`)
  * Daily ‚Üí Weekly (`df.resample('W').mean()`)

6.4 **Handle Missing Values**

* After resampling, some dates may be missing.
* Fill them with:

  * Forward Fill (`ffill`) ‚Üí Use last known value.
  * Interpolation ‚Üí Estimate values in between.

6.5 **Create Time-Based Features**

* Extract `day`, `month`, `year`, `weekday`, `season`.
* Helps capture temporal patterns.

6.6 **Add Lag Features**

* Example: `PM2.5_t-1`, `PM2.5_t-7`.
* These show how past values affect future pollution.

6.7 **Add Rolling Statistics**

* Rolling mean, median, std over 3, 7, 30 days.
* Captures moving trends.

6.8 **Add External Factors (if available)**

* Weather: Temp, humidity, wind, rain.
* Events: Festivals, traffic bans, lockdowns.

6.9 **Normalize/Scale Features**

* Scaling helps ML models perform better.
* StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1) or MinMaxScaler (0‚Äì1).

6.10 **Final Dataset Ready**

* Now your dataset has:

  * Pollution columns (resampled)
  * Time-based features
  * Lag features
  * Rolling averages
  * External factors
* This dataset is suitable for forecasting with ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.
